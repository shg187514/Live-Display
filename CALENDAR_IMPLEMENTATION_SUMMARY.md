## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Backend API Endpoints:**
```
GET    /api/bookings              - Get all bookings
GET    /api/bookings/:id          - Get specific booking  
POST   /api/bookings              - Create booking
PUT    /api/bookings/:id          - Update booking
DELETE /api/bookings/:id          - Delete booking
PATCH  /api/bookings/:id/cancel   - Cancel booking
GET    /api/bookings/date/:date   - Get bookings by date

```

### **Conflict Detection Logic:**

- Returns 409 Conflict with existing booking details
- User must resolve before saving

### **Data Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: "booking-1",
  title: "Team Meeting",
  room: "Conference Hall", 
  startDate: "2025-10-08",
  startTime: "10:00",
